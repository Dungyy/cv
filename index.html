  <h3>About Erick</h3>
  <p>I'm a Self-Educated web Developer that has a genuine enthusiasm for programming, learning new dialects and helping other people. How? or then again why? Am I self-educated? Well subsequent to being told I could in any case have malignancy, I
    needed
    to completely change me and roll out an improvement for my family and I, So what I did was get a book and some online courses and began my Tech venture. *Friendly reminder that life is excessively short, so appreciate it!*
